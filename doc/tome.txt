*tome.txt*  TOME Playbooks for your Terminal

INTRODUCTION                                    *tome*

Tome allows to to manage playbooks for you terminal in either inside Vim or with tmux.


PLAYBOOK

Playbook mode is automatically activated for any file named `.playbook*`. When you
open tome from tmux this happens automatically. See |TomePlayBook|.

For more information and setup with tmux go to https://github.com/laktak/tome

In the help below, target refers either to a `tmux pane` or the `Vim terminal`
depending on your configuration.


Default mappings                                *tome-default-mappings*

<Leader>p               Play the current line in normal mode or the selection
                        to the next (or [count] offset) target.

<Leader>P               Play the current paragraph to the next (or [count]
                        offset) target.

<Enter>                 When in playbook mode, execute `<Leader>p`.
                        Activated by |TomePlayBook|.

To change these mappings see |TomeConfig|.


COMMANDS                                        *TomeCommands*

*TomePlayBook*          Set the current buffer to playbook mode by mapping `<Enter>`.

*TomeScratchPad* [name]
                        Set the current buffer as a scratch pad that will be discarded
                        when exiting Vim and map `<Enter>`.

*TomeScratchPadOnly* [name]
                        Like |TomeScratchPad| but do not map `<Enter>`.


VARIABLES                                       *TomeVariables*


Your shell already has variables so typically you would not need them in Tome. However,
if you prefer, or if the target has no variables, you can use Tome variables (string
replacement only).


$<NAME>=VALUE
                        Define a new variable called NAME.

$<NAME>
                        Any variable is replaced with its defined value, no other
                        operations are performed. If a variable is undefined Tome
                        will open a scratchpad with the missing variables.

$<<NAME>
                        Escape, results in the literal string $<NAME>.


CONFIGURATION                                    *TomeConfig*

You can tell tome to either use tmux or the Vim terminal to execute commands. If the
`g:tome_target` variable is not set, tome will use tmux if it is installed.

```
" use Vim
let g:tome_target = 'vim'
" use tmux
let g:tome_target = 'tmux'
```


Tome will skip `$ ` at the beginning of a line because that is often used in markdown
to indicate a shell command. You can adjust this prefix or disable it with '' (needs
g:tome_vars enabled).

```
let g:tome_skip_prefix = '^\$\s\+'
```


You can disable the default keybindings with the `g:tome_no_mappings` option. It needs
to be defined before tome is loaded.

```
let g:tome_no_mappings = 1
```

Then add your own mappings:

```
nmap <Leader>p <Plug>(TomePlayLine)
nmap <Leader>P <Plug>(TomePlayParagraph)
xmap <Leader>p <Plug>(TomePlaySelection)
```


You can prevent tome to send commands to certain terminal apps. The defaults are:

```
let g:tome_no_send = ['vim', 'nvim', 'lf', 'gitui']
```


Tome variable support can be disabled with

```
let g:tome_vars = 0
```
